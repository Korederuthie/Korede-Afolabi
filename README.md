Analyzing Agricultural Portfolio Performance and Market Dynamics- Dairy Products

INTRODUCTION

In dairy farming, knowing what to do is the most important thing. This short visualization project looks at the dairy business by focusing on key variables that show how dairy portfolios change over time. With a focus on specific places in India, we want to find out how strategies, production measures, sales trends, and inventory management work in those places. This project gives a brief but useful look at the complexities of dairy farming in different parts of India by using well-thought-out visuals.

Delhi had the most land area (267,502.01 acres), West Bengal the least (117,352.71 acres). Delhi's land area made up 12.28% of the total. Kerala had the largest gap between land area and quantity. Positive correlation suggests increased profit and productivity via efficient practices

Delhi had the most cows overall, with 29060. This was 125.94% more than Tamil Nadu, which had the fewest cows overall, with 12862.
Delhi was home to 12.22% of all the cows in the world. The biggest difference between the Sum of Quantity (liters/kg) and Sum of Number of Cows was in Delhi, where Sum of Quantity (liters/kg) was 235057 times higher than Sum of Number of Cows. The sum of the number of cows and the sum of the amount (liters/kg) are linked in a good way, hence the need to intensify production by optimizing feeding, animal health care, and so on.
