Analyzing Agricultural Portfolio Performance and Market Dynamics- Dairy Products

INTRODUCTION

In dairy farming, knowing what to do is the most important thing. This short visualization project looks at the dairy business by focusing on key variables that show how dairy portfolios change over time. With a focus on specific places in India, we want to find out how strategies, production measures, sales trends, and inventory management work in those places. This project gives a brief but useful look at the complexities of dairy farming in different parts of India by using well-thought-out visuals.
