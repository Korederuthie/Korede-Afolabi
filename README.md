Analyzing Agricultural Portfolio Performance and Market Dynamics- Dairy Products

INTRODUCTION

In dairy farming, knowing what to do is the most important thing. This short visualization project looks at the dairy business by focusing on key variables that show how dairy portfolios change over time. With a focus on specific places in India, we want to find out how strategies, production measures, sales trends, and inventory management work in those places. This project gives a brief but useful look at the complexities of dairy farming in different parts of India by using well-thought-out visuals.

At 267,502.01 acres, Delhi had the most total land area. This was 127.95% more than West Bengal, which had the least total land area at 117,352.71 acres. Delhi made up 12.28% of the total amount of land area (acres).
The biggest difference between Sum of Total Land Area (acres) and Sum of Quantity (liters/kg) was in Kerala, where Sum of Total Land Area (acres) was 8,703.33 times bigger than Sum of Quantity (liters/kg).
﻿﻿Sum of Total Land Area (acres) and total Sum of Quantity (liters/kg) are positively correlated with each other.﻿﻿
﻿As the total amount of land area goes up, so does the total amount of goods, and vice versa which can potentially lead to increased profit and productivity through several mechanisms like efficient land utilization, livestock management.
